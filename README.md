# Indiegogo Campaigns Demo

## Live Demo
A live demo of this project is available here: https://campaigns-demo.herokuapp.com/

Note: This is hosted on a free Heroku plan so it may take a few seconds for the first request to load.

## Installation

### Tools

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

#### Git

Git can be installed with your favorite package manager (brew, apt, yum, etc.). Additional instructions can be found here: https://git-scm.com/downloads

##### OS X
```bash
brew install git
```

##### Ubuntu
```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```

Note: You can use a local copy of git if you do not want to `sudo` install as in the command above.

#### RVM

RVM isn't technically required, but some ruby environment manager is recommended. To install rvm, execute the following commands:
```bash
gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3
\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash
```

Additional instructions, including how to install `gpg`, can be found here: https://rvm.io/rvm/install
